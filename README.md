# SanctionsScreener
With ever increasing amount of new sanctioned entities, it has become more time consuming to track them. 
Compliance officers need to maintain Excel spreadsheets by manually adding new santioned entries and verifying them against lists of clients.
This project aims to reduce manual labour by automatically parsing sanctions from official government websites and presenting them in a desirable format.
THe work is in the process, and currently it can parse SDN entities.
UK sanctions parser is in progress.
